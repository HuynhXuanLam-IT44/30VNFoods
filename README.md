This paper introduces a large dataset of **25136 images of 30 popular Vietnamese foods**. Several machine learning and deep learning image classification techniques have been applied to test the dataset and the results were compared and report. A **decent accuracy of 77.54%** and a high **top 5-accuracy of 96.07%** were achieved. The dataset and the performance comparison of state-of-the-art algorithm tested on the dataset will be useful for ones to develop new food image classification algorithms.

3.  Model Implement: https://git.io/Jc1Bi
4.  Model Evaluation: https://git.io/Jc7fL
5.  Deployment: **temporarily inactive** due to the large model exceeded my Git LFS quota. You can watch the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV_1TGohFU8) or try to make [your own deployment](https://github.com/18520339/30VNFoods/blob/main/app.py) with [our trained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HQQaB3Tqc6m1XGxkqD5blQOO6vfdGONO?usp=sharing) using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/deploy_streamlit_app.html#deploy-your-app)
