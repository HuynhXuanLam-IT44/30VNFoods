This paper introduces a large dataset of **25136 images of 30 popular Vietnamese foods**. Several machine learning and deep learning image classification techniques have been applied to test the dataset and the results were compared and report. A **decent accuracy of 77.54%** and a high **top 5-accuracy of 96.07%** were achieved. The dataset and the performance comparison of state-of-the-art algorithm tested on the dataset will be useful for ones to develop new food image classification algorithms.
